  ## Description:
  An app to allow creation and tracking of daily workouts. Multiple exercises may be logged in a workout on any given day, along with the name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of the exercises. Cardio allows for distance tracking. My contribution -- the back end, required creating a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and route handling through Express.
